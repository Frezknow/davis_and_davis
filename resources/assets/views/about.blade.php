  <h2> About</h3>
  <br/>

  <br/>
   My name is Nathan Reynolds I am 21 and have been
    interested in web development since Freshman Year
    of highscool and haven't stopped since.
  <br/>
   I started looking into Affiliate Marketing in
    the first few months of 2018 and decided to
    pursue the field as a side hobby/job for some
    extra income.
    <br/>

  <br/>
   Being that I know how to Web Develop I jumped
    into developing this website for that very
    purpose.
